## Project Description ##
    This is project is about the practice of `fork()` and `execp()`. We were required to
    read a file and parse the contents. 
    According to the contents, we need fork a lot processes and then overwrite them for 
    execute some Unix commands that specified in files.

## How to compile and test ##
    Compile is relative easy, you can clone this repository first and enter make
    from the terminal window. 
    For the testing, it is also easy. If you successfully compiled the program, you
    will see a graphexec file that you can execute. By entering
    ./graphexec [file name]
    you can test the correctness of the program.
